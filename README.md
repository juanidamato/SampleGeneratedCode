# Sample Generated Code

This project shows an example of some artifacts generated by my other project "codegenerator".
The idea is to follow a clean architecture where there is a clean separation of layers responsability based on abstractions

It uses well known external tools as:

-Fluent Validation
-MediaR
-Automapper
-Dapper

Pending to implement:
-Telemetry 
-Logs
-Other Utils interfaces and their implementations
