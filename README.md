# Sample Generated Code
<p>Work in progress... not ready yet :( </p>

<p>This project shows an example of some artifacts generated by my other project "codegenerator".</p>

<p>The idea is to follow a clean architecture where there is a clean separation of layers responsibility based on abstractions.</p>

### It uses well known external tools such as:

<ul>
   <li>Fluent Validation</li>
   <li>MediatR</li> 
   <li>Automapper</li> 
   <li>Dapper</li> 
</ul>

### Pending to implement:

<ul>
 <li>Telemetry</li> 
 <li>Logs</li>
 <li>Other Utils interfaces and their implementations</li>
</ul>
